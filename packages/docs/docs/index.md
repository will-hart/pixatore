Tauri Game is a template for simple multiplayer games using

- pixi.js for rendering,
- colyseus.js for real-time multiplayer (client and server)
- Vue 3 for GUI
- tauri for bundling to a standalone app

The repo is intended to be used as either a template, or to be forked directly.
The repo will provide a minimal set of libraries and utility functions that can
be used to develop multiplayer games.

> **NOTE** the library and documentation are a work in progress

See the [roadmap](roadmap.md) for more information about current and upcoming features.
